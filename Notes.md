# 001 - Day 1 -Beginner - Working with Variables in Python to Manage Data

    ##Naming Rules
    - Can't start with numbers
    - Use underscores to use multiple words


# 002 - Day 2 - Beginner - Understanding Data Types and How to Manipulate Strings

    ##Strings
    - Index starts at zero
    - "Hello"[0] --> "H"

    ##Integer
    - 123
    - 123_000 underscores help make it readable

    ##Float
    3.14159

    ##Boolean
    True
    False

    ##Type Check
    type(variable_name) --> int, etc.

    ##Type Conversion
    str()
    int()
    float()

    ##Mathematical Operations
    +   = addition
    -   = subtraction
    *   = multiplication
    /   = Division (results in float)
    **  = To the power of

    ##Order of operations
    Follows PEMDAS

    ##More operations
    //  = Divide & Round to integer
    /=  = Divide byitself
    +=  = Add itself 
    -=  + subtract itself

    ##f-String
    allows mix of data types
    f("your score is {score}, your height is {height}")
